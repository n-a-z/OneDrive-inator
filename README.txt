Works for: Windows 10
This script relocates the user profiles folders onto OneDrive, effectively creating a substitute to the Windows Roaming Profile.
All selected user profiles are backuped in real time to the cloud. This works two ways, so if data on the computer would be destroyed (i. e. the hard drive would be erased) the same script will bring all the files back.
Uses: Companies and private users who do not have server space for Roaming Profiles but have an Microsoft O365 accounts may use this script as a substitute.
